Linear programming problem solver, ver 1.0.
This program solves linear programming problems using different methods 
(currently implemented simplex method and boundary points busting method). 
Below you can enter input data: parameter of minimization c (to find 
optimal x for min<c, x>) and linear constraints. To finish inputting 
constraints, just press enter one more time (input blank line). 
It's assumed that all variables in restrictions are not less than 0. 
Variable name must consist of english letters and arabic numerals.
First letter of variable name must be letter. Each line must be finished 
with semicolon. Multiplication signs must be avoided. 
WARNING: input is case-sensitive! 
Here is example of correct input: 

Insert vector c:
>> 1 1
Insert linear constraints:
>> 3.14 - y1 <= 0;
>> 2x + y1 >= 6;
>> y1 - 2.4x = -6;
